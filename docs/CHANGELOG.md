# Work Log

This file tracks what has been done during Codex sessions so progress is not lost
across crashes or restarts.

## How to use

- Append a short entry per session or task.
- Include date/time, goal, and outcome.
- Note any follow-ups or blockers.

## Entries

### 2025-12-22
- Goal: Add a persistent work log for crash recovery.
- Outcome: Created docs/CHANGELOG.md with a session template.
- Follow-ups: Fill in real date and append future session entries.

### 2025-12-22
- Goal: Record current implementation status after restart.
- Outcome: Engine implementation exists (types, runtime, validation, expression eval, rule modules, save/load, tests). Latest commit: feat: bootstrap engine codebase.
- Follow-ups: Confirm spec review checkpoint and align any gaps with worldLoom-spec.
