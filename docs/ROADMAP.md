# Roadmap

This file tracks upcoming work derived from the worldLoom specification. It is not a promise of dates.

## Near Term
- Harden public API ergonomics and documentation.
- Expand validation diagnostics and error reporting.
- Improve test coverage for deterministic runtime behavior.

## Spec-Driven Next (Not Yet Implemented)
- Lore categories and reveal states (known/discoverable/hidden) as first-class schema.
- Companion entities with relationship variables and participation rules.
- Relationship mechanics (romance as specialization) with thresholds and narrative triggers.
- Session orchestration layer for multiplayer-safe, deterministic input aggregation (v1+).

## Out of Scope (v1.0)
- Real-time combat simulation
- Procedural map generation
- AI DM runtime
- Presentation-layer rendering
