# Phase 2 Plan (Future Implementation)

## Planned Work

- Spec alignment: reconcile engine behavior with canonical spec docs and record any deltas.
- Validation expansion: add optional-system validation (companions/relationships/sessions) and tests.
- Public API stabilization: review exports, finalize API surface, and document versioning guarantees.
- Optional feature polish: add helper APIs for lore reveal + relationship/companion conditions and validation hooks.
- Session integration: connect session resolution to action/exit selection or provide a high-level session executor.
